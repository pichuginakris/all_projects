We make eco-friendly toilet paper (as well as tissues and paper towels) and donate 50% of our profits to help build toilets for the 2.3 billion people in need.We absolutely love doing good, but we're also exceptionally good at it. To date, we've donated over AUD$8.3 million to fund sanitation projects around the globe. We've grown quickly – selling directly to customers across three continents and establishing a strong B2B business that's expanding to the US market this year.Our team is made up of over 80 amazing humans working out of Melbourne, Los Angeles, China, and Manila. We're working hard to reach our ambitious goals and diversify our product range to ensure we can have the greatest impact possible – both for the planet and its people. With your help, we're hoping to increase our annual donation 10-fold in the next couple of years and continue to make the most beautiful, eco-friendly goods around.A bit about the role:We are looking to add an Accounts Receivable Expert to support our B2B customers. This new roll (pun intended) will sit in our Growth team and will support the small but mighty Numbers Scrunchers (think Finance people who have a lot of fun!) teams here at Who Gives A Crap. Reporting to our B2B Account Manager, this role will be leading the charge (woop more word play!) to ensure timely and accurate payment collections from all our B2B customers and support our B2B Accounts with best-in-class customer experience for all accounts. You will handle all accounts receivable projects, processes and process improvements, and take ownership of collecting outstanding payments. You'll also be able to create custom reporting for the Account Management team (and to bring the Number Scrunchers up to speed), reduce churn and turn insights into recommendations for the Account Management and Sales teams.You'll probably have a few 'oh, crap' moments along the way but you'll pick yourself back up, dust yourself off and ensure we're all a bit wiser because of them. You will also feel totally supported and have a hell of a good time, we promise! This is a unique opportunity to work in a high-growth startup while applying your skills to a meaningful cause (we donate 50% of our profits to charity). You'll also work within a collaborative team of experienced humans who care just as much about helping their teammates grow as they do about making a difference in the world. And... we get to make toilet jokes all day.We're hiring this role for our Manila hub — however, this is a remote working role.If you worked here this past month here are some things you might have been involved in:Connected with B2B customers to ensure payments are up-to-date and everyone is happyReduced the level of credit exposure for any sales made on credit (whew!)Rang customers who had outstanding debt and responded to any other billing inquiriesShared billing statements with any outstanding accounts to every customer (and followed up)Provided extra support to our key customer accounts including monthly statements sprinkled with TLCTook over the reins of an 80-percent-there process to wrangle outstanding payments including a mix of automation and manual tasks to drive it towards 100-percent-doneStarted brainstorming innovative ways to continually improve our process and still deliver with delight to our client partners while getting sh!t doneManaged freelancers with immediate and ongoing collections projects that need supportDeveloped a collections plans strategyPerformed credit checks and approved large customer ordersManaged the weekly updates of the payments status for paid orders on our internal systemsPerformed some timely account reconciliations and patted yourself on the backWho you are:You're a numbers geek and not ashamed of itWhether you have a past life in finance or accounting, or are a well-organized and self-motivated individual with strong math and communication skills, you're excited to explore this world of debt and customer management further. Ultimately you want to be able to contribute your passion for all things number-y and help a growing brand with their business accounts is just the icing on top.You can communicate like a bossYou have excellent communication chops - you might even call them your superpowers - and know how to draft up friendly invoices, accurate customer statements and proactive catch-ups over the phone just as easily. You also know how to keep your teams in the know with internal reporting and how to break down complex data sheets into digestible, friendly pieces of information.Details might be your middle nameNothing gets past you, and we mean nothing. Details are your jam. You have the eyes of an eagle and you have a knack for spotting any inconsistencies, discrepancies or whoops moments. You know the terrible embarrassment of having to resend an update due to human error and mistakes, and made it your mission in life to get things as right the first time as possible, ideally before your work is shared with anyone else both internally and externally.You know how to wield a spreadsheetWhether it's a Google Sheet or Excel, or some other fun form of keeping track of everything, you love a good spreadsheet and know how to keep track of all things numbers-y.You give a crapYep. We're all here because we genuinely want to make the world a better place with our work, and we want you to want that too! Awwww.Why you should work with usEvery minute you spend working with us, you're making a difference. The more we grow, the bigger an impact we'll have. Sell your soul no longer! We think that's a pretty great perk, but we don't stop there…If you have a great idea, we'll do everything we can to make it happen. This is the kind of role that will be hard to find anywhere else: you'll work with an incredible bunch of passionate people to grow a fast-paced startup at a crucial point in its trajectory.The job is also super flexible, something we're working hard to hold onto even as we grow really quickly. We started the business remotely, and now have hubs in 4 cities around the world. Until the WFH ""new normal"" took effect, the Manila team spent three days in our Downtown office, and two days working from home. We plan to pick this schedule back up once it's safe to do so! And while we don't have a Friday drinks cart (yet), you will get free toilet paper. A lot of it. And nothing beats that.Lastly, you get to say the word 'crap' more than in any other job. Guaranteed.SalaryThis depends on your experience but just because we're a social enterprise doesn't mean you'll get paid peanuts. Think chocolate covered macadamia nuts with some extra perks thrown in. In other words, we pay competitively and are determined to make this the best job you'll ever have!Who Gives A Crap also provides 4 weeks paid annual vacation (yay!), flexibility to take extra unpaid leave, private health insurance coverage, generous maternity/paternity leave and a whole lot of other stuff.",https://ph.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=ed32c63a64fb098f&from=vj&pos=bottom&sjdu=kREejwbDMkx22-K2gj7AzYDDplm6SwWjHcxyoDIphKkyolxU5C9r-QAzWWcMzFk5kN0wkll9wDHc3mnStM4Hmg&astse=bc1cc91847d3640c&assa=2277

Therefore, roads are considered as an important foundation for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and a prerequisite for bringing communities together. In 2016, only 24.6% of all provincial roads in the Philippines are of acceptable quality. Of the 12,726km of provincial core roads, 57.2% are unpaved and in need of upgrading, while 20.2% are in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation. The situation is similarly dire for the 19,098 km of non- core roads, with 67% needing upgrading and 7% in need of rehabilitation.To address this situation, DILG and DBM jointly launched the CMGP. By providing the provinces with financial investment for capital outlay, the Programme addresses the under-investment of local roads, to improve national local road connectivity, increase economic activity and improve public access to facilities and services in the provinces. Moreover, the Program also supports governance reforms, quality assurance and the strengthening of governance processes, specifically on Local Road Management (LRM) and Public Financial Management (PFM), among others.In partnership with DILG, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched the Project “Paving the Roads to SDGs through Good Local Governance” (Roads2SDGs) to provide support on the quality assurance, governance reform components of CMGP, and citizen engagement in road governance through the “Roads to SDGs” framework.The Roads2SDGs Framework is anchored on two complementing foundational precepts – (1) SDGs are potent to inform and enhance road governance; and, (2) good roads governance positively ushers in the attainment of the SDGs. This informs and enhances the prioritization, planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of road infrastructure projects to the achievement of SDGs, incorporating the elements of partnership building, climate change, disaster risk reduction, gender mainstreaming, and citizen participation for transparency and accountability, among others. In this manner, the SDGs provide a framework to strengthen the governance of road projects, which in turn, will positively impact the achievement of the SDGs.The Philippines is one of the most affected countries in the Southeast Asian region by the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of July 2020, the total number of cases in the country is at 93,354. There have been 2,023 deaths and 65,178 recoveries so far. In response, the government launched a multi-sectoral response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) and since March 2020, the government has implemented various quarantine measures in major cities and provinces. As a result, the project incurred delays due to the suspension and cancellation of activities. Thus, DILG and UNDP agreed to extend the partnership/project up to March 2021.As the project is about to end, a terminal evaluation will be conducted to assess the project’s accomplishments and the quality of implementation and analyze overall added value to local road governance reforms. In addition, lessons learned, and best practices will be identified and analyzed to inform future programming.Evaluation criteria and key guiding questionsRelevanceTo what extent was the project in line with the national development priorities, the country programme’s outputs and outcomes, the UNDP Strategic Plan and the SDGs?To what extent does the project contribute to the theory of change for the relevant country programme outcome?To what extent were lessons learned from other relevant projects considered in the project’s design?To what extent does the project contribute to gender equality, empowerment of women and to the human rights-based approach?EffectivenessTo what extent did the project contribute to the country programme outcomes and outputs, the SDGs, the UNDP Strategic Plan and national development priorities?To what extent the project outputs were achieved?What factors have contributed to achieving or not achieving intended country programme outcomes and outputs, and project outputsWhat, if any, alternative strategies would have been more effective in achieving the project’s objectives?To what extent have stakeholders been involved in project implementation?To what extent are project management and implementation participatory and is this participation contributing towards the achievement of the project objectives?To what extent has the project contributed to gender equality, the empowerment of women, and the realization of human rights?EfficiencyTo what extent was the project management structure as outlined in the project document efficient in generating the expected results?Were the selected implementation modalities (i.e., direct implementation, engagement of implementing partners) the most efficient way to implement the Project?How effective were the project coordination and responsiveness mechanisms including between the implementing agencies, with the Project Board, with the Government, and with other project stakeholders/beneficiaries?How well did the project complement any other initiatives existing in the same area and what efforts did the project make to identify such initiatives and strengthen synergies?To what extent have resources been used efficiently?

The evaluation process is expected to follow a participatory and consultative approach ensuring close engagement with government counterparts, UNDP Country Office, Project Team, and other relevant stakeholders. The evaluation plan should outline a mixed-method approach to data collection and analysis. The methodologies for data collection may include but not necessarily be limited to:Desk review of documentation provided by the Project, which shall include the following: project document, annual work plans, activity designs, Project Board minutes, and other pertinent documents produced by the implementing units.A systematic review of monitoring data from the project (i.e., quarterly and annual reports, documentation of activities, and monitoring reports) and other key sources of data.Semi-structured interviews. Key informant and focus group discussions, as appropriate, with all major stakeholders, partners, and beneficiaries including the implementing agencies, provincial government units, partner civil society organizations (CSOs) Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), citizen volunteers/monitors, and community/individual beneficiaries. When applicable, beneficiaries should represent diverse groups, including women and youth from different ethnic groups and social-economic statuses.

Philippines Merchant Payment Digitization Consultant,https://ph.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=3d22eb98d7424b5f&fccid=a9a8bf2e786e3726&vjs=3,,ActiveUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP),"UNCDF works in challenging environments – remote rural areas, countries emerging from conflict – and paves the way for others to follow.",Philippines,14 days ago,"BackgroundUNCDF is the UN’s capital investment agency for the world’s least developed countries (LDCs). It creates new opportunities for poor people and their communities by increasing access to inclusive finance and investment capital. UNCDF focuses on Africa and the poorest countries of Asia and the Pacific, with a special commitment to countries emerging from conflict or crisis. It can provide seed capital both grants and loans as well as technical support that will improve poor peoples’ lives.UNCDF works to enlarge peoples’ choices: it believes that poor people and communities should take decisions about their own development. UNCDF works in challenging environments – remote rural areas, countries emerging from conflict – and paves the way for others to follow. Its programmes are designed to catalyze larger investment flows from the private sector, development partners and national governments, for significant impact on the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger, Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, and Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability.Established by the General Assembly in 1966 and with headquarters in New York, UNCDF is an autonomous UN organization affiliated with UNDP.UNCDF is the UN’s capital investment agency for the world’s 47 least developed countries (LDCs). With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers “last mile” finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development. This last mile is where available resources for development are scarcest; where market failures are most pronounced; and where benefits from national growth tend to leave people excluded.UNCDF’s financing models work through two channels: savings-led financial inclusion that expands the opportunities for individuals, households, and small businesses to participate in the local economy, providing them with the tools they need to climb out of poverty and manage their financial lives; and by showing how localized investments — through fiscal decentralization, innovative municipal finance, and structured project finance — can drive public and private funding that underpins local economic expansion and sustainable development. UNCDF financing models are applied in thematic areas where addressing barriers to finance at the local level can have a transformational effect for poor and excluded people and communities.By strengthening how finance works for poor people at the household, small enterprise, and local infrastructure levels, UNCDF contributes to SDG 1 on eradicating poverty with a focus on reaching the last mile and addressing exclusion and inequalities of access. At the same time, UNCDF deploys its capital finance mandate in line with SDG 17 on the means of implementation, to unlock public and private finance for the poor at the local level. By identifying those market segments where innovative financing models can have transformational impact in helping to reach the last mile, UNCDF contributes to a number of different SDGs and currently to 28 of 169 targets.UNCDF hosts the Secretariat of the Better Than Cash Alliance.The Better Than Cash Alliance is a partnership of 75 governments, companies and international organizations that accelerates the transition from cash to digital payments in order to reduce poverty, drive inclusive growth and accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.Billions of dollars in cash payments and transfers are made daily in emerging and developing economies, including payment of salaries, social welfare and relief, payments to suppliers, remittances, etc. The problems with these cash payments include a lack of transparency, accountability and security, as well as inefficiency. Furthermore, the individuals who receive the cash payments are often part of the 1.7 billion excluded from the formal financial sector. This means they are excluded from access to a range of appropriate and affordable financial services to help them save safely, take advantage of economic opportunities and reduce their vulnerability to risk.Shifting these payments from cash to digital has the potential to improve the lives of low income people, particularly women -who are twice as likely to be excluded from the financial system, while giving governments, the development community and the private sector a more transparent, time and cost efficient, and often safer means of disbursing payments. Digitizing payments can also contribute to women’s economic participation by providing them with more control over family finances, increasing personal security, and improving economic opportunities.The Alliance Secretariat works with its 75 members to navigate their digitization journeys, by:Providing advisory services based on member prioritiesSharing action-oriented research and fostering peer learningConducting advocacy at national, regional and global levelThe Better Than Cash Alliance Secretariat Core Values:Achieving togetherStriving for excellenceService orientedResults orientedDuties and ResponsibilitiesScope of ServicesThis role will support the in-country advisory services offered to the Government and Corporate Sector Alliance members in the Philippines. As identified by the ‘The State of Digital Payments in the Philippines ’country diagnostic published in 2019, merchant payments constitute the largest share of overall payments in country. Given that only 12-15% of all merchants accept digital payments there is much headroom for growth. The Philippines has also seen considerable growth of the e-commerce sector with recorded annual revenue of USD 3 Bn in 2019 and is slated to grow to USD 12 Bn by 2025 . While there is an increasing number of merchants who are leveraging digital platforms (e.g. social media and/or e-commerce platforms) to market their wares, payments for goods are still largely made through Cash-on-delivery (COD), which accounts for 85% of sales.The COVID-19 crisis has emerged as a tipping point for digital payments in country. Notably, there has been a substianital increase in use of digital payments platforms in April and May 2020 . In this period, more than 4 million new digital accounts have also been opened among banks and non-bank electronic money issuers. This trend reflects an important mindset shift on the part of consumers in terms of digital payment adoption. A unique opportunity has emerged to leverage this momentum to focus efforts on addressing unique barriers faced by key merchant segments.The Better than Cash Alliance together with the Government of the Philippines has convened a ‘Public-Private Working Group on Digitizing Merchant Payments’ that brings together different stakeholders (financial service and technology providers, Government, Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies, merchants' associations) to co-create a more robust value proposition for small merchants to adopt digital payments both online and at physical stores.Public -Private Working Group on Digitizing Merchant Payments in the PhilippinesThe working group is chaired by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and was inaugurated on 23 July 2020. It is established for a period of one year, with option to be renewed upon agreement by all working group members. Given the unique circumstances due to COVID-19, all meetings in 2020 will be conducted via videoconference. The Working Group is scheduled to meet every two months or as necessary with specific status updates on key objectives and deliverables; the tentative timelines for subsequent meetings this year are in September and November.Its key objectives are to:Increase the use of digital payments in a responsible manner at both physical and online merchants by identifying specific adoption and use barriersIdentify and agree on actor-specific actions to drive merchant payment digitization, including time-bound pilots focused on specific segments of merchantsServe as a consultation body for national strategies (e.g. e-commerce roadmap) and be a part of national advocacy campaigns on digital paymentsShare experiences, lessons learned, and collaborate on mutual research interests (e.g. merchant segmentation)The Better than Cash Alliance seeks to hire a consultant based in Manila who will work closely with the Southeast Asia Lead to support the Government of the Philippines, through the BSP and DTI to enhance the adoption and use of digital payments by small merchants.

INTERNSHIP TOPIC:""Rural and remote road safety in Mongolia.""2. SUMMARY OF JOB DESCRIPTION:Although 91% of traffic crashes in Mongolia are recorded in Ulaanbaatar, 73% of road fatalities occur in rural areas. Dirt and gravel roads are widespread in rural areas and road shoulders are often unsealed. Traction on these surfaces is poorer making it easy to lose control of your vehicle, particularly on curves. Rural road use and associated crashes have a number of common characteristics which tend to lead to higher fatality rates, such as longer travelling distances, varied road environments (including a higher proportion of unsealed dirt roads), a more varied vehicle population (heavy vehicles, mining vehicles, agricultural, etc), higher travel speeds and a higher risk of serious injury or fatality, and a higher proportion of single-vehicle run-off-road crashes.The intern will provide insights into issues relating to rural and remote road safety in Mongolia. The insights from this research will contribute to ADB's road safety work in Mongolia, particularly the ongoing Western Regional and Regional Road projects and the proposed Aimag and Soum Centers Green and Resilient Regional Development Investment Program.Conduct desktop and stakeholder research to understand more about the causes and characteristics of rural road crashes in MongoliaCollate available data on rural road safety and assets for Mongolia and develop a simple database, including list of roads and their attributes e.g. presence of road signs or notIdentify road safety interventions that have been used in rural areas in countries with similar geographiesIdentify key steps for Mongolia in promoting rural road safetyIdentify design interventions for road safety, and road asset management activities, crucial to maintain and improve safety of rural and unpaved roadsMake a presentation to ADB MNRM, ADB HQ, MRTD and other key stakeholders on findings and recommendations3.
